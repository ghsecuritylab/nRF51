=== Required Software/Hardware

. NRF51 Development Kit        (PCA10028)
. Signalling Unit
.. Keysight Technologies T1212 (formerly AT4 wireless)
.. BITE Protocol Tester        (release 1.0.16.0)

=== TEST SPECIFICATION

- LL.TS.4.2.1
- GAP.TS.4.2.1



== Advertiser

The timeslot advertiser interface is based on the Bluetooth standard HCI
interface, but only implements a small subset of the functionality. All
interface functions are found in the Include/nrf_advertiser.h file.  Test
setup and management commands were added to facilitate automated testing.

=== Changes

- General discoverable flag was turned off to match testing spec.
- Incorect sender Address field in Broadcast was fixed.
- TX_Add flag bit location was fixed.
